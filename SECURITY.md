## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the process below:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
   Instead, report the vulnerability privately to the maintainers.

2. **How to report:**  
   - Send an email to **[christophernoblett47@gmail.com]** (replace with your project’s security contact).  
   - Include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact.

3. **Response expectations:**  
   - You will receive an acknowledgment within **72 hours** of your report.  
   - We will provide updates on the investigation at least once per week until resolution.  
   - If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate a release.  
   - If the vulnerability is declined (e.g., not reproducible or out of scope), we will explain why.

4. **Disclosure:**  
   - Once a fix is available, we will publish a security advisory.  
   - Credit will be given to the reporter if they wish to be acknowledged.

## Additional Notes

- Please ensure you are running a **supported version** before reporting issues.  
- For general bugs or feature requests, use the standard issue tracker instead of the security contact.
